      ignore_errors: true
# Why the condition - " reg_ocp_co.resources | length > 2 "
# When a cluster starts coming up during a bootstrap process and the api starts
# responding, it starts up the cloud-credential controller first. Mind you at
# this point the bootstrap server is resonding to the api calls.
# Following that the network operator starts. Can't remember now which is the
# 3rd operator that starts. I think it is the machine-config operator.
# Either way, there is an edge case that results in intial 2 cluster operators
# to have status that would meet our success criteria that we are looking for.
# The success criteria being.
# available=True, progressing=False, degraded=False
# So the condition waits for at least 3 or more of the cluster operators to
# start up before we check for our success criteria.

# NOTE: For a Disconnected cluster replace the queries with the queires listed
#       at the end of this file.

# NOTE: For a cluster where all your worker nodes are not in the load baalcner
#       pool for *.apps subdomain, please refere to the 2nd notessection.

# What do the queries do ?
#
# Step1: Gather all the cluster operators. The json is stord in reg_ocp_co
#
# Step2: Gather the status of the "Available" column for all the operators
#        This is restured as a list within in a list
#        We flatten the list and filter it through unique
#        If All the operators have a status of True for the available column
#        you will end up with
#        available: ['True']
#        If even 1 operator has a status of False the resultant list will be
#        available: ['True', 'False']
#
# Step4: we do the same for "Progressing" and "Degraded" columns as well
#
# Step5: Loop through ignoring all error until all the cluster operators go
#        active. Final good state will be
#        available: ['True'] , progressing: ['False'] , degraded: ['False']
#
# You can chain your post install configure playbooks to kick in after this
# playbook complete.

# NOTE: When setting up a disconnected cluster, the openshift-samples operator
#       will not go active because it will not able to download the necessary
#       imagestreams that are required to complete the setup of the samples
#       operator.
#
# We need to update the json queries to filter out the samples operator from
# the list. Below is how you would update the queries to filter out the samples
# operator.
#
# vars:
#   available_query: "resources[?metadata.name!='openshift-samples'].status.conditions[] | [?type=='Available'].status"
#   available: "{{ reg_ocp_co | json_query(available_query) | flatten | unique }}"
#   progressing_query: "resources[?metadata.name!='openshift-samples'].status.conditions[] | [?type=='Progressing'].status"
#   progressing: "{{ reg_ocp_co | json_query(progressing_query) | flatten | unique }}"
#   degraded_query: "resources[?metadata.name!='openshift-samples'].status.conditions[] | [?type=='Degraded'].status"
#   degraded: "{{ reg_ocp_co | json_query(degraded_query) | flatten | unique }}"

# NOTE: Assume you are setting up large cluster with several worker nodes.
#       However you only have 2 x of your worker nodes that you plan on
#       classifying as infra nodes added to the load balancer pool for incoming
#       requests for port 80 and 443. (Basically for the *.apps subdomain)
#       When the cluster boostrap is being completed, you could end up with 2
#       router pods for the default ingress congroller runing on 2 worker nodes
#       that are not part of the load balancer pool. In a cloud based
#       deployment you would have all the workder nodes added to the load
#       balancer pool. That is not the case when you setup in baremetal or in
#       a vsphere cluster. In such a scenario you will notice that that console
#       and authentication operators would never complete their installation.
#       The below json query would just ignore the status of the "console" and
#       "authentication" operators.
# vars:
#   available_query: "resources[?(metadata.name!='authentication'&&metadata.name!='console')].status.conditions[] | [?type=='Available'].status"
#   available: "{{ reg_ocp_co | json_query(available_query) | default([])| flatten | unique }}"
#   progressing_query: "resources[?(metadata.name!='authentication'&&metadata.name!='console')].status.conditions[] | [?type=='Progressing'].status"
#   progressing: "{{ reg_ocp_co | json_query(progressing_query) | default([]) | flatten | unique }}"
#   degraded_query: "resources[?(metadata.name!='authentication'&&metadata.name!='console')].status.conditions[] | [?type=='Degraded'].status"
#   degraded: "{{ reg_ocp_co | json_query(degraded_query) | default([]) | flatten | unique }}"

== Playbooks to configure OpenShift 4.x cluster


Couple of ansible roles to configure serveral components for a freshly intalled
openshift cluster. Typical configurations that need to be performed are


* setup ldap oauth
* sync user groups from ldap to openshift
* etc..

IMPORTANT: None of these role are written to be used blindly. They are provided
as a POC/ minimum viable option to get you kickstarted without having to put an
effort to figure out exactly what all needs to be done.

A lot of assumptions are made.
So please walk through the roles first, before attempting to run them.

=== Runing the indivdual roles
You can run individual roles by runnning ansible playbook against the
<role>/apply/main.yaml playbook in each of the individual roles.

----
ansible-playbook roles/<role-name>/apply/main.yaml
----

=== Setting up LDAP

==== LDAP oAuth
The ldap-oauth role handles configuring the default identity providers for the cluster. An OCP cluster can have multiple identity providers eg: LDAP oAuth and a htpasswd file etc. Ours clusters are setup to have just the ldap oauth identiy provider.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook roles/ldap-oauth/apply/main.yml -e ldap_bind_password=<ldap-service-account-password>
----
[NOTE]
The extra variable ldap_bind_password will not be required once we have the creds being pulled from secret server

==== LDAP to OCP group synchronisation
The ldap-group-sync role handles synchornising a whitelisted set of AD groups to the OpenShift cluster.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook roles/ldap-group-sync/apply/main.yml
----

=== Setting up Trident csi for OpenShift 4.x
The role here is just a skeleton or sample.
It needs a lot of work to make it a more generic role to be used for any
tridnt installation. Then again the number of variable or parameters that will
need to be passed to the role will be quite a lot so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook roles/trident/apply/main.yml
----

=== Setting up a cronjob to take regular snapshot of the etcd database
This role should work out of the box or a regular OCP 4.x cluster.
It has only been tested on  UPI OCP 4.2 cluster running on vSphere.

The etcd-backup role work on disconnected OpenShift cluster as well.
YaY

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook roles/etcd-backup/apply/main.yml
----

This will create a volume named `demo-etcd-backup`
and drop the etcd snapshots in there.
Default frequency is every 5 minutes (useful when testing)
Please adjust it accordingly

=== Installing OpenShift Service Mesh (ossm)
This role should work for a regular OCP 4.x cluster and installs servicemesh.
There are no variables to customise the storage requirements for the some of
the servicemesh controlplane instances.

You will have to edit the yaml files where they are defined.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook roles/service-mesh/apply/main.yml
